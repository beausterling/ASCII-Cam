## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: ES modules with separate files for clean separation of concerns
- Phase 1: p5.js for rendering handles webcam capture and canvas drawing
- Phase 1: Green-on-black terminal aesthetic for classic retro hacker feel
- [Phase 01-foundation-project-setup]: ES modules with explicit .js extensions for native browser support
- [Phase 01-foundation-project-setup]: CDN-only dependencies (no build step) for static site deployment
- [Phase 01-foundation-project-setup]: figlet.js CDN fonts instead of self-hosted for zero file management
- [Phase 01-foundation-project-setup]: ESLint flat config (eslint.config.js) due to ESLint 10.x requirement
- [Phase 01-foundation-project-setup]: figlet.js v1.8.0 (v1.10.0 only ships ESM, no UMD global for script tags)
